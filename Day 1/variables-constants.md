# Variables: How to create Variables and Constants
When programming in Swift, you often need to store data, either using variables or constants. Variables are declared with var and can be changed during program execution, whereas constants use let and cannot be altered once set. Swift's syntax avoids unnecessary complexity, such as semicolons, and follows naming conventions like camel case for clarity. For example, you can create and modify a variable ```var name = "Ted"``` or use a constant ```let character = "Daphne"``` that can't be changed. Printing values helps in debugging, and using constants is recommended for code optimization and preventing unintended changes.
